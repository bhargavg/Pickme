# Pickme [![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
Pickme turns your boring `UICollectionView` into an awesome 3D picker view.

## Understanding Version Numbers
`Pickme` supports both legacy Swift 2.3 and latest Swift 3.0. To achieve this, the following release strategy is followed:

* Odd number versions for `Swift 2.3` releases
* Even number versions for `Swift 3` releases

## Installation
Only `Carthage` is supported as of now.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```
github "bhargavg/Pickme"

and `carthage update`. For full list of command, please refer [Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
